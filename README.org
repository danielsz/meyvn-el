* Meyvn client

This is the official Emacs client for the [[https://meyvn.org][Meyvn]] build tool.

It complements Cider and interfaces with a nREPL connection to add capabilities such as hot-loading, reload on save, teardown and rebuild of application state, and more.

** Installation

*** MELPA

Meyvn is available on the MELPA repository.  

*** Manual installation

- Clone this repository.
- Add to your ~init.el~ the following snippet:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((meyvn-el (expand-file-name "~/path/to/meyvn.el")))
  (when (file-exists-p meyvn-el)
    (autoload 'meyvn-connect meyvn-el "Meyvn client" t)))
#+end_src

This will lazily load ~Meyvn~ which will come into full effect after the user summons ~meyvn-connect~ to connect to a Meyvn-enhanced nREPL. 
When this Emacs package becomes available via MELPA, the above will not be necessary anymore.

** Configuration

The following code snippet is needed to enable the reload on save feature. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'meyvn-setup)
#+end_src
